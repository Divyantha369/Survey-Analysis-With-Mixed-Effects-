# Survey-Analysis-With-Mixed-Effects-


This repository contains code and analysis for a mixed-effects model study evaluating survey responses before and after an intervention.

## Key Insights
Controlling for individual patient differences, scores on the survey questions were significantly higher after the intervention compared to before (odds ratio for higher scores ≈ 1/0.52 = 1.92). This implies an increased likelihood of selecting a higher rating post-intervention.
